# ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡ Smart Test Automation with Playwright MCP and Claude LLM

A practical exploration of intelligent test case generation by integrating **Playwright MCP** with **Claude LLM**. This project focuses on automating the **Employee Management** workflow of the OrangeHRM demo portal using a modular Page Object Model (POM) structure â€” generated entirely through AI-assisted prompts.
